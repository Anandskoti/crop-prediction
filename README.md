Crop prediction using Random Forest involves leveraging ensemble learning to predict agricultural yields accurately. The algorithm trains multiple decision trees on diverse data subsets and combines their outputs for robust predictions. Key input features include environmental data (temperature, rainfall), soil data (type, pH), historical crop yields, and remote sensing data. The process includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using metrics like MAE and RMSE. Random Forest excels in accuracy, robustness, feature importance assessment, and scalability, making it valuable for yield forecasting, decision support, and risk management in agriculture.
